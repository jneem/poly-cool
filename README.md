# poly-cool

A pre-alpha crate for finding roots of low-degree polynomials.

This crate's goal is to provide well-tested and decently-optimized
methods for finding roots of polynomials. Currently, we have
implemented Blinn's method for cubics and Yuksel's algorithm
for polynomials of arbitrary degree. The "well-tested"
and "decently-optimized" parts are still aspirational.
